Four years ago, I was a high school student. 
Four years later, I am a college graduate.
Two years after that, I earned a master's degree.
I was too broke to get a PhD, but girls never stopped wanting the D. 
Luckily, my GPA was better than every class being a C. 
I think I am the person that I always wanted to be.
I am going to say that everything is going to be okay.
