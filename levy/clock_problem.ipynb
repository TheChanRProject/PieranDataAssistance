    "Since the hour hand is moving $ 30 ^\\circ $ per hour, we can now say that our $ \\alpha $ is the input of degrees the hour hand has moved since the start of the day which is midnight and find out information such as how many hours have past since midnight.\n",

    "In our example input of 190, we can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 190 \\space \\% \\space 30 = \\text{remainder} \\space (\\frac{190}{30}) = 10 $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{180}{30} = 6 $$ \n",

    "$$ 2 * \\frac{360^\\circ}{60}  = 12^\\circ $$ \n",
